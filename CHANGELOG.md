## [Unreleased]

### Features
- feat(cli): `workspaces remove --workspace=<hash>` — destructive workspace deletion with `--dry-run` preview and `--force` safety gate; backed by `DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/:hash` REST endpoint wrapped in a single transaction (#155)
- feat(cli): wake-up command — pretty/JSON workspace briefing at session start (#151, PR #216)
- feat(cli): `--scope=all` flag on query/search/vsearch for cross-workspace search (#156, PR #217)
- feat(config): `NANO_BRAIN_CONFIG` env var support — precedence `--config` flag > env var > `~/.nano-brain/config.yml`. Enables Docker/k8s deployments to point at a container-specific config without mounting over the host's default.

### Documentation
- docs(roadmap): reconcile ROADMAP.md status with actually shipped features (#214, PR #215)
- docs(readme): document `NANO_BRAIN_CONFIG` env var + Docker example

## [2026.5.267] — 2026-05-26

### Features
- feat(summarize): session summarization pipeline — LLM-powered structured summaries for harvested sessions
- feat(summarize): map-reduce pipeline with strip, parallel map, hierarchical reduce for sessions up to 1M tokens
- feat(summarize): OpenAI-compatible LLM client with SSE streaming, retry (3x backoff for 429/5xx)
- feat(summarize): persist summaries as `.md` files + embed in vector DB under `session-summary` collection
- feat(summarize): idempotent upsert via `summary://opencode/{id}` source path — unchanged sessions skipped
- feat(summarize): cross-session relationship links (parent/child/sibling) in summary header
- feat(harvest): wire summarizer into OpenCode SQLite + Claude Code harvesters — runs after successful harvest
- feat(config): `summarization` config block — provider_url, api_key, model, max_tokens, concurrency

### Documentation
- docs: add `summarization` config section to README with ai-proxy setup example
- docs: document `NANO_BRAIN_SUMMARIZE_API_KEY` env var

## [2026.8.19] — 2026-05-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Workspace guard** — server no longer creates a database for `--root` paths not declared in `config.workspaces`. Falls back to closest configured workspace via longest-prefix match, then first workspace. Prevents orphaned DB accumulation. Closes [#19](https://github.com/nano-step/nano-brain/issues/19).
- **CLI pre-resolution** — `cli/index.ts` no longer pre-resolves the DB path from `process.cwd()` for the `mcp` command, which was bypassing the workspace guard entirely.
- **CI: skip existing release** — `Publish Stable` workflow no longer fails when the GitHub release tag already exists. Closes [#22](https://github.com/nano-step/nano-brain/issues/22).
- **CI: peer deps** — use `--legacy-peer-deps` in GitHub Actions to resolve `tree-sitter` peer conflict.

### Infrastructure

- Added `develop` branch → `npm publish --tag beta` + GitHub pre-release on every push.
- Added `master` branch → `npm publish --tag latest` + GitHub release with auto-generated changelog.
- Added npm, CI, and license badges to README.
- CLAUDE.md: every npm publish must have a changelog; create GitHub issue before starting any task.

## [2026.6.2] — 2026-03-17

### Features — Memory Intelligence v2

- **Entity Pruning** — background job (6h interval) soft-deletes contradicted entities after 30 days and orphan entities after 90 days; hard-deletes after 30-day retention.
- **LLM Categorization** — async fire-and-forget assigns `llm:` category tags after every `memory_write`.
- **Preference Learning** — Thompson Sampling bandits track which content types the agent retrieves most; RRF blend weights adapt over time.
- **Schema v7** — `pruned_at` column on `memory_entities`.

### Features — Search Quality

- **Query Expansion** — LLM generates 2–3 query variants before search for better recall.
- **Tag Display** — `auto:` and `llm:` tags now visible in search results (verbose + compact modes).
- **Backfill CLI** — `nano-brain categorize-backfill` to LLM-categorize existing documents.
- Wave 7: recency boost for sessions/memory collections.
- Wave 6: length normalization penalty using `charLength`.
- Wave 5: temporal metadata (`createdAt`) in `SearchResult`.
- Wave 4: Qdrant `project_hash` payload filter and backfill.
- Wave 3: FTS workspace isolation (strict filter).
- Wave 2: fix `supersedeDocument` bug.
- Wave 1: `domain_type` and `last_reinforced_at` schema columns.

### Features — Token Reduction

- **MCP Response Caps** — hard limits on all unbounded tools: `memory_get` (200 lines), `code_impact` (depth 3, 50 entries), `code_context` (20 callers/callees).
- **Compact mode default** — search tools return compact format (~60% fewer tokens).
- Heading-aware chunking (900 tokens, 15% overlap).

### Infrastructure

- Replaced sqlite-vec with Qdrant as sole vector store.
- Added benchmark suite — data generator, runner, compare CLI.
- Consolidation decisions now reconciled automatically in the background.

**Install:** `npm install nano-brain@2026.6.2`
